1-) Replace function

When I took information from API, I neede to convert HTML entities to UTF-8, I write function and converted them.

2-) Convert Data

When I the handle data from API it was not ready to use. I map through on all data with my first map function. Firstly I need to put the correct answer into the other answers randomly. I did it with Math.random() and splice as you can see in the first box. But my job had not done. I added id to answers and questions. I needed to add 'isSelected' and 'isCorrect' properties to array of answers object. I did it with nested map function. And lastly I needed to return object to use it in the other components. Now my data ready to use.

3- ) Change Is isSelected

When user click an answer I needed to change it is is Selected value. With handle in g thiws value, I could style selected item conditionaly also, I could compare if it also has is correct property or not. I did it with immutable way.


4-) Delete Wrong answers

I needed to create a logic for deleting two wrong answers. I did it with immutable way again. firsty I created clone arrays for questions, currentquestion and it's answers. Then I filtered answers array and returned it the array of wrong answers, with checkin if isCorrect !== true. Then with splice and Math Random Method I deleted first wrong answer randomly before handled it. I did same thing for second wrong asnwer and setState. Now I deleted two wrong answers succesfuly.
if thereis no 2 two wrong answers, %50 still works. 

5-) Hint Handler Disabled.

I have 5 hint chance, If user use his 5 chance 5 disabled the buton. Same thing for %50 chance, user have just one chance. 
Also for delete one answer I needed to arrange dynamically splice index with random. Because array length wasnt stayed same. 


6-) Test Cases,

If user delete 3 wrong answer, chose correct answers doesnt work,
After user input the name one time, system doesn't ask aagain.
ifThere is just one answer, answer will be selected automatically

7-) Talk about correct answers.

8-) How I handled Sound (timeout, function, conditional rendering)

9-) Includes, split

10-) & > * {
    z-index: 1;
  }

11-) display inline flex. I needed to use flexbox for each button that has exact width not 100% width. display inline flex was solution.

12-) conditional animation with css helper styled components v4.0 show how to animate the button
13-) smaller line height arranges bottom line

14-) clip path without touching box shadow.

15-) Animated placeholder.

16-) 2 different transition effect timing on buttons and link animation
17-) x:hover::before
18-) How I calculated remained time
